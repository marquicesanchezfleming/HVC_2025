HEALPIX resampling of Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) Survey of Galactic
HI (Kalberla+ 2005)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the data that were used in Land & Slosar, arXiv:0706.1703
and given for public use through LAMBDA.  Description of the survey in
the original README is as follows:
The LAB survey contains the final data release of observations of
21-cm emission from Galactic neutral hydrogen over the entire sky,
merging the Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey (LDS: Hartmann & Burton 1997,
Cat. VIII/54) of the sky north of -30{deg} with the Instituto
Argentino de Radioastronomia Survey (IAR: Arnal et al.
2000A&AS..142...35A and Bajaja et al. 2005, Cat. VIII/75) of the sky
south of -25{deg}. The angular resolution of the combined material is
HPBW ~ 0.6{deg}. The LSR velocity coverage spans the interval -450
km/s to +400 km/s, at a resolution of 1.3km/s. The data were corrected
for stray radiation at the Institute for Radioastronomy of the
University of Bonn, refining the original correction applied to the
LDS. The rms brightness-temperature noise of the merged database is
0.07-0.09 K. Residual errors in the profile wings due to defects in
the correction for stray radiation are for most of the data below a
level of 20-40 mK. It would be necessary to construct a telescope with
a main beam efficiency of {eta}MB>99% to achieve the same accuracy.
The merged and refined material entering the LAB Survey of Galactic H
I is intended to be a general resource useful to a wide range of
studies of the physical and structural characteristices of the
Galactic interstellar environment. The LAB Survey is the most
sensitive Milky Way H I survey to date, with the most extensive
coverage both spatially and kinematically.


The data were resampled on NSIDE=512 healpix grid using nearest
neighbour pixel. The NSIDE=512 with approx 0.1 sq deg pixels is
probably oversampling the original data, which is stored in
approximately 0.25 sq deg pixels. The healpix map is a two-channel
map: the first channel contains the averaged values of corresponding
pixels from the LAB data, while the second channel is weight, i.e. the
number of original LAB pixels (i.e. velocity slices) that went into
that particular healpix pixel.  With exception of thin velocity
slices, the sky coverage is pretty uniform.

The naming convention is as follows: 
LAB_fullvel.fits - the entire velocity range
LAB_HV.fits  -30 .. 30 km/s, low velocity
LAB_MV.fits  -100 .. -30 km/s, intermediate velocity
LAB_LV.fits  -500 .. -100 km/s, high velocity
LAB-cutXXX.fits  XXX .. XXX+10 km/s range. Note that number is the lower limit not the mean.
