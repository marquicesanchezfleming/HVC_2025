Flatten time series spectrum, kinda like residual
Do this for each indivual spectra, not overall dynamic spectra
Look for anything above a certain SNR and note the frequency they occur at 

create algorith that goes through every single spectra, calculates its SNR, and basically anyhting funny with it
